# Code-commenting
- Design project on Code Comment Generation

# Dataset
- We use the dataset of the [DeepCom code](https://github.com/xing-hu/EMSE-DeepCom) for our training. We have trained mostly on Google Colaboratory. Recommend trying for the university's HPC (if not too busy) or GCloud credits (if **ANY** of your cards can get through without a refund).
